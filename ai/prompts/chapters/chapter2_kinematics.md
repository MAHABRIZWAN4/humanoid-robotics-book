# Chapter 2: Kinematics of Humanoid Robots

## Overview
This chapter will delve into the fundamental principles of kinematics as applied to humanoid robots. It should cover both forward and inverse kinematics for various types of robot joints and linkages. Emphasize the unique challenges and considerations for humanoid structures, such as redundancy, singularities, and task-space control. Include examples and derivations where appropriate.

## Key Topics to Cover
- Review of rigid body transformations (rotation matrices, homogeneous transformations)
- Forward Kinematics: Denavit-Hartenberg (DH) parameters, product of exponentials (POE) formula
- Inverse Kinematics: Analytical and numerical solutions, Jacobian matrix
- Redundancy and its management in humanoid robots
- Singularities: identification and avoidance
- Task-space vs. joint-space control
- Introduction to dynamics (brief overview as a precursor to future chapters)
