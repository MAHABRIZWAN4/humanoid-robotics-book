# AI/Spec-Driven Book Creation Constitution

## Core Principles

### 1. Accuracy & Verifiability
All factual claims in the book must be backed by credible sources (e.g. research papers, documentation, official references).
Source URLs or citation metadata must be included with every non-common-knowledge statement.
AI-generated content must not hallucinate facts — any uncertainty must be flagged for human review.

### 2. Clarity & Readability
The book content must be written clearly, in proper English (or the target language), with correct grammar and punctuation.
Sections and chapters should follow a consistent structure (e.g. introduction → explanation → example → summary).
Use meaningful headings, subheadings, bullet lists or tables where appropriate for readability.

### 3. Modular & Maintainable Structure
The book must be organized into clear chapters / sections (e.g. “Chapter 1: …”, “Chapter 2: …”), each in its own Markdown file, suitable for Docusaurus.
Content must avoid monolithic files — each major topic or subtopic should be a separate module/file to allow easier updates, navigation, and reuse.

### 4. Reusability & Documentation of Process
Keep full history of AI prompts, decisions, and architecture/design rationale (i.e. prompt history, ADR-style notes) — store as part of project memory.
Ensure that metadata such as sources, editorial notes, version/date, and authorship (AI vs human) is recorded for each section/chapter.
Document technical decisions regarding site generation, deployment, formatting, styling, and configuration in a consistent, versioned way.

### 5. Consistency & Style Guidelines
Use a consistent writing style throughout the book (tone, terminology, formatting).
Define a style guide for headings, code blocks (if including code or examples), links, citations, images, etc.
Maintain consistency across chapters — e.g. naming conventions, markdown formatting, indentation, line-break rules.

### 6. Quality Assurance & Review Process
Every chapter/content generated by AI must be reviewed by a human before publishing.
Use fact-checking and plagiarism detection where applicable.
Maintain a checklist for each section: completeness, citation correctness, readability, formatting compliance, link validity.

### 7. Deployment & Build Standards
The book site should be built using Docusaurus, with configuration version controlled.
Deployment to GitHub Pages must be automated (e.g. using CI or script) and repeatable.
All build artifacts, markdown source, config files, and static resources (images, assets) must be included in version control.

### 8. Project Governance & Versioning
Use semantic versioning or date-based versioning for the a book (e.g. “v1.0.0” or “2025-12-06”) and record in a changelog or metadata file.
Amendments to constitution (if any) must be versioned, documented, and approved (i.e. change log, reason for change).
All major changes (new chapters, restructuring, styling changes) should go through a PR (or equivalent review) and be documented.

## Governance
Because we are using AI-generated content, it's critical to ensure **accuracy, traceability, and human review**.
A book involves many moving parts (writing, structure, publishing, updates), so a **modular, maintainable, and standardised approach** is essential.
Maintaining history, metadata and process documentation ensures **reproducibility, future updates, and collaboration clarity**.
Once constitution is created and committed, **no spec, plan or implementation** should violate these principles without an explicit amendment and justification.
