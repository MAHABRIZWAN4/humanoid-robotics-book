## Prompt

/sp.constitution Poject: AI/Spec-Driven Book Creation  
Purpose:
- We are creating a book using AI-driven workflow. The book will be authored collaboratively by an AI (Claude Code) and human editor, and published as a static site using Docusaurus and deployed to GitHub Pages.  
- This constitution sets the foundational principles which all subsequent content generation, planning, documentation, and publishing must adhere to.  

Core Principles & Standards:

1. **Accuracy & Verifiability**  
   - All factual claims in the book must be backed by credible sources (e.g. research papers, documentation, official references).  
   - Source URLs or citation metadata must be included with every non-common-knowledge statement.  
   - AI-generated content must not hallucinate facts — any uncertainty must be flagged for human review.  

2. **Clarity & Readability**  
   - The book content must be written clearly, in proper English (or the target language), with correct grammar and punctuation.  
   - Sections and chapters should follow a consistent structure (e.g. introduction → explanation → example → summary).  
   - Use meaningful headings, subheadings, bullet lists or tables where appropriate for readability.  

3. **Modular & Maintainable Structure**  
   - The book must be organized into clear chapters / sections (e.g. “Chapter 1: …”, “Chapter 2: …”), each in its own Markdown file, suitable for Docusaurus.  
   - Content must avoid monolithic files — each major topic or subtopic should be a separate module/file to allow easier updates, navigation, and reuse.  

4. **Reusability & Documentation of Process**  
   - Keep full history of AI prompts, decisions, and architecture/design rationale (i.e. prompt history, ADR-style notes) — store as part of project memory.  
   - Ensure that metadata such as sources, editorial notes, version/date, and authorship (AI vs human) is recorded for each section/chapter.  
   - Document technical decisions regarding site generation, deployment, formatting, styling, and configuration in a consistent, versioned way.  

5. **Consistency & Style Guidelines**  
   - Use a consistent writing style throughout the book (tone, terminology, formatting).  
   - Define a style guide for headings, code blocks (if including code or examples), links, citations, images, etc.  
   - Maintain consistency across chapters — e.g. naming conventions, markdown formatting, indentation, line-break rules.  

6. **Quality Assurance & Review Process**  
   - Every chapter/content generated by AI must be reviewed by a human before publishing.  
   - Use fact-checking and plagiarism detection where applicable.  
   - Maintain a checklist for each section: completeness, citation correctness, readability, formatting compliance, link validity.  

7. **Deployment & Build Standards**  
   - The book site should be built using Docusaurus, with configuration version controlled.  
   - Deployment to GitHub Pages must be automated (e.g. using CI or script) and repeatable.  
   - All build artifacts, markdown source, config files, and static resources (images, assets) must be included in version control.  

8. **Project Governance & Versioning**  
   - Use semantic versioning or date-based versioning for the book (e.g. “v1.0.0” or “2025-12-06”) and record in a changelog or metadata file.  
   - Amendments to constitution (if any) must be versioned, documented, and approved (i.e. change log, reason for change).  
   - All major changes (new chapters, restructuring, styling changes) should go through a PR (or equivalent review) and be documented.

Rationale:
- Because we are using AI-generated content, it's critical to ensure **accuracy, traceability, and human review**.  
- A book involves many moving parts (writing, structure, publishing, updates), so a **modular, maintainable, and standardised approach** is essential.  
- Maintaining history, metadata and process documentation ensures **reproducibility, future updates, and collaboration clarity**.  

Commitment:
- Once constitution is created and committed, **no spec, plan or implementation** should violate these principles without an explicit amendment and justification.
