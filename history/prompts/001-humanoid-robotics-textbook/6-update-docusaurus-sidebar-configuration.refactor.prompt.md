  why previous files are still occure I want occur a new TextBook modules chapters

## Response snapshot

Updated `my-website/sidebars.js` to use an autogenerated sidebar for the `TextBook` directory, which dynamically includes all modules and chapters and removes outdated hardcoded references.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Resolved 'Module not found' errors by updating Docusaurus sidebar to autogenerate navigation from the TextBook directory.
- 🧪 Tests: Verification through Docusaurus build process implicitly.
- 📁 Files: 1 file updated: `my-website/sidebars.js`.
- 🔁 Next prompts: N/A
- 🧠 Reflection: Successfully identified the root cause of the Docusaurus build error as an outdated sidebar configuration. Updated the `sidebars.js` to use `autogenerated` feature which dynamically creates navigation from the new TextBook module structure, aligning with user's intent.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: Previous attempt to address this issue would have been to look for other errors when the core problem was related to how Docusaurus sidebars work.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): N/A
